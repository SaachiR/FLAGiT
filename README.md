# FLAGiT
< ZOO Hackathon 2019 DELHI WINNING PROJECT >
FLAGiT has the potential to help the NGOs and other wildlife organizations by giving them an authority to monitor the critical regions where trafficking/other illegal activity occurs. When such a location/entity is found, it is flagged by the NGO investigator. And if there is another NGO who wants to monitor or investigate the same entity, then the name of the investigator of the other NGO will be displayed keeping in mind the security factor and the NGO can contact them through email relay. Since if many Investigators/NGOs come into action(working on the same entity) without knowing the existence of each other, then due to over-policing and enquiries the trafficker might get alert.

Also, the centralised hub or point of contact is the enforcement agency which monitors everything. Agency will monitor the NGOs as well as investigators. And NGOs will be monitoring their investigators. This provides a way to stop data leakage by making it difficult for the investigator to switch NGO as agency will take action on such issues.

Further, after implementing blockchain model, this application will provide a platform for data sharing between organisations working on same entity having trust factor between them (a secure way of collaboration).
